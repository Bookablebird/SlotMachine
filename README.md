# Tuplapotti is a slotmachine made with java, created by Paavo Helin(me), Ilias Doukas, Darja Raevaara and Joachim Grotenfelt.
This project was for the course "Oliot"(Objects) at Metropolia, University of applied sciences.

# *Notice* 
This project was done as a group, and I can not take full credit for it.
